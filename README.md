### Hi ðŸ‘‹ I'm Seth, and I love building WordPress powered web apps.

By day, I'm Lead Developer at the [Pew Research Center](https://www.pewresearch.org), where I work on our Gutenberg-first WordPress powered digital news app, PRC App (catchy name right?).

As with most self-taught WordPress developers PHP is my first love but with the introduction of Gutenberg and the community call to "learn Javascript deeply" I've also fallen in love with React and am constantly experimenting with the intersection of PHP and React.
